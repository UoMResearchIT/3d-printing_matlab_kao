Simulations of 3D printing --- Application support

- Original enquiry (root directory) was help with coding up an algorith.
- The *iCSF* folder deals with a bigger scale simulation, but the code is written using very large matrices which take too much memory.
I have rewritten attempting to only store in memory what is required. The first simulation I have rewritten, the rest remain for the user to complete.
