Simulations of 3D printing --- Application support

- Original enquiry (root directory) was help with coding up an algorith.
- The *iCSF* folder deals with a bigger scale simulation, but the code is written using very large matrices which take too much memory.
I have rewritten by only storing in memory what is required. The first simulation I have rewritten, the rest remain for the user to complete.
- The *testing* branch contains a smaller problem size so that I can test the changes I made on *master* produce the same results as the original code.
